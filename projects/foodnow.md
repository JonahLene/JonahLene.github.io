The project aimed to develop a comprehensive online marketplace for local food vendors within the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UH Manoa) campus. The platform was designed to connect students, faculty, and staff with a variety of food options offered by different vendors on campus. Users could explore vendor profiles, view menus, and place orders, enhancing convenience and accessibility to a diverse range of culinary choices.

My role in the project was multifaceted. As a full-stack developer, I took responsibility for designing and implementing key features of the platform. This included developing the user interface and ensuring a seamless user experience. I collaborated closely with my teammates to bring our vision to life and implemented functionality such as vendor profiles, and menu displays.

Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into the challenges of developing a complex web application that involves multiple stakeholders and intricate functionality. Working on the project enhanced my proficiency in technologies such as React for the frontend and Meteor for the backend. I also honed my skills in database design, user authentication, and collaborative problem-solving. Furthermore, the project provided a practical understanding of the importance of effective communication and coordination within a development team, especially when translating design concepts into functional code. Overall, the project served as a significant learning opportunity, allowing me to apply and expand my technical skills while contributing to the creation of a user-friendly and impactful platform for the UH Manoa community.
