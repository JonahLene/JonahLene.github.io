summary: "In this first class project, I created a program that acted as a Bank Database in which it could store, add, and delete user accounts.

Since this was an introductory course in the C language, this project was used as my first big assignment where I was able to use all my newly acquired knowledge in C and create a program that represents a bank database. In this project, I had to create multiple C files, header files, and object files. Some of the names of these files include database.o, record.h, user_interface.c, e.t.c. After creating these files, I then linked them together to create an executbale file titled project.

The Bank Database project was an individual project, so I was soley responsible for all of the work that had to be done. I was given around a week to complete this assignment, and throughout that week I would work on completing each part in order to be able to put all my code together. When I did complete each part and linked each object file to make my executable program, I was then able to debug and fix any errors that I made. 

From this experience, I was able to improve on my coding skills and gain more knowledge on how coding in the C language is different from other coding languages I learned such as Java and Python. I also was able to learn how banks databases operate and how difficult it can be to not develop errors when users add or delete their account.
